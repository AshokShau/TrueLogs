# TrueLogs — A Privacy-Respecting Caller ID

A lightweight, Truecaller-inspired Flutter app that shows caller information using the Truecaller API — but without the creepy tracking, silent contact uploads, or invasive analytics.

> Because knowing who’s calling shouldn’t cost you your privacy.

## Features

* Look up phone numbers using the Truecaller API
* Identify numbers from your call logs
* View clean, detailed contact information
* Sleek, modern UI built with Flutter
* No spying, no sneaky data collection — just what you need

## Getting Started

Download the APK from the [releases](./releases) page and install it on your device.
No sign-ups, no fine print — just run it.

## Requirements

* Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0) if you want to build it yourself
* A valid Truecaller key (you can extract this from the official app using interception techniques)

## Screenshots

*(Gonna add soon)*
